## Developing

The `main` branch is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against. The PR will generate a deploy preview for QA before merging.

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```
3. Copy the `index.html` path into your browser. This can be done by right clicking on the file in visual studio code and selecting `copy path`.
4. Push the new branch to the cloned repository and create a pull request to the `stepzen-dev` organization repo.
